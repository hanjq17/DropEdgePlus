In Structure-Aware DropEdge, we enhance graph edge dropping technique with two structure-aware samplers, the layer-dependent sampler and feature-dependent sampler, to further relieve the over-smoothing issue in deep graph networks.

## Dependencies


Please check out the Python environment depicted in `requirements.txt`.



## Data

The semi-supervised setting strictly follows [GCN](https://github.com/tkipf/gcn), and the full-supervised setting follws [DropEdge](https://github.com/DropEdge/DropEdge). The co-author and co-purchase datasets can be downloaded from https://github.com/shchur/gnn-benchmark. 



## Running the Experiments


The code has been tested in the above-mentioned environment with `Python=3.6.2`. We recommend using conda.

```bash
conda create -n xxx python=3.6.2
conda activate xxx
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To reproduce our results, just run the scripts in the `scripts` folder. For example,

```bash
sh scripts/semi/citeseer_appnp.sh
```
